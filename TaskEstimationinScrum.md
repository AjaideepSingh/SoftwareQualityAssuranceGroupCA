# Task Estimation in Scrum
## _What is Agile Estimation_
![points](https://stylersonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/blog5.png)
Agile Estimation is done by the entire team during a Sprint Planning Meeting. The objective of the estimation 
would be to consider the User Stories for the Sprint by priority and by the ability of the team to deliver the 
work. At the product backlog, the scrum team estimates the effort involved in completing the work for a user 
story. The size of the product increment is estimated in terms of User Story Points.

## _Planning Poker_

Planning poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating the effort of user stories in scrum. To start a
planning poker session, the product owner reads an agile user story or describes the feature to the team of 
estimators. The estimators discuss the feature and ask questions in order to help them make an educated estimate.
Each estimator holds Planning Poker cards with values like 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100. These numbers
represent the number of story points in which the team estimates. Each estimator selects one card to match their
estimate and then all cards are revealed at the same time.

General rule of thumb, if a story is scored as a 13 or higher, then it needs to be broken down into multiple 
smaller user stories. Breaking down a complex task into smaller ones removes to risk of unpredictability and 
defects. [Article ](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker)

#### Basic Rules
1. Team members have their virtual cards. The popular planning poker sequence in scrum is known as the 
fibonacci sequence, it is numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100 etc. If the estimators had too many options
 for example numbers 1 - 100, it would make the process inefficient. Following the fibonacci sequence creates
  greater efficiency.
2. A member of the team, usually the product owner will read each story out loud to the group.3. The team 
discusses the story.
4. Each team member selects a card representing his or her estimate of the size for the user story.
5. When everyone has chosen, all cards are revealed at the same time.
6. If all estimators chose the same card, then that number becomes the consensus. The group can move on to the
 next story. If not, the estimators dicuss why they chose the card that they did and then the group can re-estimate.

#### Guidelines
- Estimate in relative terms rather than absolute terms. For example, if the first user story is a 2. All other 
items on the list can be estimated relative to this. Something that will take four times as long would get an 8, 
and so on [Read More ](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/how-can-we-get-the-best-estimates-of-story-size) .
- Use a timer of some sort to limit discussion - 1 minute
- Not everyone will estimate. It is important that those who are doing the work are the ones who estimate.
- When there is a tie in the voting between two sizes which are consecutive, go with the larger size as a 
safety net.
- Have fun!  Playing planning poker is meant to be a collaborative exercise and make work enjoyable.

#### Why use Planning Poker?
- Allows the team to estimate tasks relative to one another.
- Team members feel more committed to a plan that they were a part of so therefore the result is usually better.
- Possible issues are identified sooner rather than later
- Creates new ideas. Having a discussion about a user story allows for ideas to be sparked possibly optimizing a
 solution at a lower estimate


## _Other practices that aid Task Estimation_

#### Top-down approach

![top_down](https://cdn.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/assets/Screen-Shot-2018-05-11-at-3.39.54-PM.png)

A 'top-down' approach to task estimation ignores the traditional techniques to allocating tasks by assigning teams to tasks with a timeframe. This occurs before the entire project's time estimate is taken into account,  This is a bottom-up approach. A top-down approach accounts for potential pitfalls the project may run into based on previous data. It uses various models to do this which can accurately estimate **time, cost, effort**, and other factors.

The following is an extract from an [Artcile](https://www.infoq.com/articles/software-estimation-important/) that discusses this topic:

> Managers can run “what if” scenarios to account for various challenges that may occur throughout the course of development (i.e., “What if we run over budget?” or “What if we have to do some re-work?”).
> They can then make adjustments as necessary before work commences, potentially saving significant time and money in the long run.


#### Focus on Five Core Metrics

To reduce the inital intimidation and messiness that may come with starting a large new project, Project Managers are advised to focus only on Five Core Metrics to deliver accurate and credible estimates:

1. _**Duration**_
2. _**Effort**_
3. _**Size**_
4. _**Productivity**_
5. _**Reliability**_

Larry Putnam Sr., who wrote a book on these Five Metrics had the following argument:

> by simplifying the estimation process and tuning into the areas that truly matter can help managers better assess risk factors, anticipate and respond to changes, and successfully re-plan their projects as necessary. 
> It addresses the common misperception that software project estimation is too hard and complicated. That certainly does not have to be the case.
