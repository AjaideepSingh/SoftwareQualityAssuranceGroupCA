# Project Plan

In order to complete the project the first task necessary was to understand the brief. To gain better understanding of what is required we organized a group call to discuss the project and clarify any queries any of us may have. On this call we agreed what the different tasks were in order to complete the project successfully. The tasks being to introduce the topics briefly and then summarize the most important guidelines in bullet points / diagrams.

##### Topics
- Task Estimation in Scrum
- Coding Standards
- Code Reviews

The next step is to decide who is going to work on what task. As a group of 4, with three topics to focus on, we assigned 2 members of the group to each topic and 2 to the project plan and introduction.
##### Tasks
| Task | Team Member |
| ------ | ------ |
| Task Estimation in Scrum | Ella Burke & Niall Murphy|
| Coding Standards | Ajaideep Singh & Cormac Mattimoe|
| Code Reviews | Ajaideep Singh & Niall Murphy |
| Project Plan/ Introduction | Ella Burke & Cormac Mattimoe|

The final step is to decide in what order the work needs to be carried out. As two members of the team will be working on the same topics we must be able to review each other's work to avoid conflicts or issues. As we carry out research for our assigned topics it is important to notify the second member of the team on the topic of the guidelines weâ€™ve chosen to write about to avoid duplication and redundant work . To start, the project plan was written and a Github Repository was made so that all team members can work on a feature branch before merging into the develop branch. Before merging into the develop branch all team members must review the work.
