# Project Plan

# Introduction
This is a company handbook which defines a set of software quality assurance practices and guidelines for Codeck Software. In order to work the “Right Way”, this handbook should be used by the company’s software engineers and quality assurance teams to follow best practices. This handbook will be of extreme benefit to the company when onboarding new members of staff as it will allow all of its employees to be on the same page as everyone has their own style of programming.

The purpose of this document is to provide a standard across the company in regards to Task Estimation in Scrum, Coding Standards and Code Reviews. This handbook is intended to reduce the risk of unpredictability and defects making it into production. This handbook will define the topic briefly and showcase the best chosen practices and standards drawn from personal experiences amongst the three areas. There will be references provided to articles where necessary for further reading.


In order to complete the project the first task necessary was to understand the brief. To gain a better understanding of what is required. We organized a group call to discuss the project and clarify any queries any of us may have. On this call we agreed what the different tasks were in order to complete the project successfully.
The objective of this task is to introduce the topics briefly and then summarize the most important guidelines in bullet points and diagrams.

## Here is a Project Plan

##### Topics

- Task Estimation in Scrum
- Coding Standards
- Code Reviews

The next step is to decide who is going to work on what task. As a group of 4, with three topics to focus on, we assigned 2 members of the group to each topic and 2 to the project plan and introduction.
##### Tasks
##
| Task | Team Member |
| ------ | ------ |
| Task Estimation in Scrum | Ella Burke & Niall Murphy|
| Coding Standards | Ajaideep Singh & Cormac Mattimoe|
| Code Reviews | Ajaideep Singh & Niall Murphy |
| Project Plan/ Introduction | Ella Burke & Cormac Mattimoe|
| Sprint Retrospective | Ella Burke, Cormac Mattimoe, Ajaideep Singh & Niall Murphy|

The final step is to decide in what order the work needs to be carried out. As two members of the team will be working on the same topics we must be able to review each other's work to avoid conflicts or issues. As we carry out research for our assigned topics it is important to notify the second member of the team on the topic of the guidelines we’ve chosen to write about to avoid duplication and redundant work . To start, the project plan was written and a Github Repository was made so that all team members can work on a feature branch before merging into the develop branch. Before merging into the develop branch all team members must review the work.



## Git Flow Process

- Review pull request.
- Accept the pull request.
- Pull the latest from develop to local branches.
- One team member must update the source repository with all changes by bringing in the changes from their  local develop branch.
- Publish the release branch.
- Fix any issues found in release branch.
- Complete Release.
