## What are Coding Standards?
Coding Standards are a set of guidelines a programmer will follow for the speific programming language theyre using for that project. These standards define a wide range of activities such as programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of the program in the written language.

# Why Projects need Coding Standards
When developers learn a new programming language in most cases they will not program in the way that it has been suggested to us they will use their own style. The problem arises when we start to code bigger projects that include additional hands involved, conflicts may arise in the way individuals write code.

# Solution!
A Coding Standards document tells developers what guideliens to follow when writing their code. This will make sure the code base in the entire project is consistent. This solution makes the code easier to understand and also ensures that any new developer will know what is going on throughout the project.

The following are points you must note when following Coding Standards.
1. Is the code legible?
2. If you return to the code at a later point in time will you understand what is going on?
3. How are you commenting in the code base?
4. Have you wrote more efficient code that is quicker to write but harder to understand?

Once the aboce 4 points are taken into consideration a team can begin to draft their Coding Standards document.
