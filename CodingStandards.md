## What are Coding Standards?
Coding Standards are a set of guidelines a programmer will follow for the speific programming language theyre using for that project. These standards define a wide range of activities such as programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of the program in the written language.

# Why Projects need Coding Standards
When developers learn a new programming language in most cases they will not program in the way that it has been suggested to us they will use their own style. The problem arises when we start to code bigger projects that include additional hands involved, conflicts may arise in the way individuals write code.

# Solution!
A Coding Standards document tells developers what guideliens to follow when writing their code. This will make sure the code base in the entire project is consistent. This solution makes the code easier to understand and also ensures that any new developer will know what is going on throughout the project.

The following are points you must note when following Coding Standards.
1. Is the code legible?
2. If you return to the code at a later point in time will you understand what is going on?
3. How are you commenting in the code base?
4. Have you wrote more efficient code that is quicker to write but harder to understand?

Once the above 4 points are taken into consideration a team can begin to draft their Coding Standards document.



# Benefits of Coding Standards

*  ### Efficiency 
     * Implementing coding standards would help the team to detect the problems early or even prevent them completely. This will increase efficiency throughout the software process.

*  ###  Risk of project failure is reduced
     * Many times it happens that IT projects fail due to problems while developing software.
     * Implementing the coding standards reduces many problems and the risk of project failures.
     
*  ### Maintainability
    * If the coding standards are followed, the code is consistent and can be easily
     maintained. This is because anyone can understand it and can modify it at any point in time.
*  ### Identify Errors
    * It becomes really easy to locate and correct bugs in the software if the source code is    written in a consistent manner. 
    





## 1. Readability
 * Readability in software programming can be defined by the ease with which the software is read and understood. Readability of software can be somewhat objective
 

## 2. Indentation
* Making code more readable one should use white spaces properly. 
* Correct indentation is very important to increase the readability of ones code. 
* All braces should start from a new line and the code following the end of braces also should start from a new line.  
* Each nested block should be indented and spaced correctly.


#### SonarQube

* SonarQube empowers all developers to write cleaner and safer code.
* It is an automatic code review tool that detects bugs, vulnerabilities and other potential issues in source code.
* It can be used to assist in maintaining a particular Coding Standard.
