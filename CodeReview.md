# Code Review

## What is Code Review?
Code review is a software quality assurance activity where by source code is viewed and assessed by one or several people. Code reviews occur when there is a completion of a software develeopment feature or as a safeguard in prevention of errors. At least one of the persons must not be the code's author.

## Code Review Process
![Code review process](code_review_process.png)

- Author sends piece of code to be reviewed
- Code is analaysed and assessed by an automated reviewer based on criteria such as complexity, compilation lack of documentation and failed unit tests
- The code is then passed onto a team of reviewers, who can discuss it, ask and provide suggestions for each line and vote to summarise its feedback using one of these two use cases:
 **1. The changes cannot be implemented**
 **2. The changes can be implemented**
- If the piece of code is up to standard and has been analysed by all team members, it can be accepted for merging to the main branch.


## Anecdotal Resources

There are many forms of evidence online to portray the importance of code review, and the consequences of not having code up to standard. Code reviewers are very harsh when it comes to critiquing.

The following quote is extracted from **'I ruin developers’ lives with my code reviews and I'm sorry'** by Philipp Ranzhin.

> Once upon a time there was a guy on my team so weak that he was 
> going to be fired (a developer! Fired!).
> Every comment of mine was another nail in his coffin.
> I could almost hear the bang of the hammer every time I clicked “Submit review”. 
> He was a nice person and I almost felt bad for him, but it didn’t stop me from tearing his work to shreds.
> I had an inalienable right to criticize his work, right? I’m a better developer, therefore I’m right. 
>No one wants to say that bad code is good, right? He was eventually fired, not before leaving him without the customary bonus for a couple months.
